Summary
=======

Stream2ip is a one-click GUI to stream audio to clients in the LAN/WLAN

Installation
============
Dependencies:
python, python3 (>=3.0), python3-gi, python3-dbus, gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1, librsvg2-common, libgtk-3-0

Optional packages:
python3-apt for installing missing packages on Debian
ushare or minidlna - for UPnP file streams
pulseaudio-dlna - for pushing audio to a DLNA renderer
icecast2, darkice, ices, or ices2 - for internet radio streaming

Stream2ip will install and run without these packages but for full functionality installation of all of them is recommended. If apt is our package manager stream2ip will prompt for installing additional packages if needed.

If not installed by our DEB installer or with the install script then please copy all files to the desired location (default is /usr/share/stream2ip/) and make sure stream2ip.py is executable. Configuration files will be stored in ~/.config/stream2ip.

For a manual install from the project root run

sudo install

To be able to change the output sink automatically (not needed for internet radio or uPnP) we need to edit the following line in  /etc/pulse/default.pa

    load-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false
